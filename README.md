# CEG-2136-Lab3
Designing, simulating, building, and testing an arithmetic logic unit with 16 different operations

In this lab students will design, simulate, build and test an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), employing Quartus II as a development environment and the Altera DE2-115 board as experimental platform. ALU has to execute 16 different operations on two operands of 4 bits, and will provide a 4-bit result along with 4 status bits (Overflow, Sign, Zero, Carry). The input operands will be generated by slide switches, while the result and the status bits will be displayed on LEDs.
